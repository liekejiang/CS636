### Model
please download my model from my google drive and put in the main folder with train_frcnn_cat_V2.py
used model: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vhlzoeuI1wE-quXe2y4otDpGGzZwZuKd
trained model(need to change filepath):  https://drive.google.com/open?id=10PS24oROhW9znwIFhmdjY31behQ5CsOB
VGG16 pretrained weight, training from zero: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-rmzbzS596CPdEwwyG9aTsdhev4urTB0

I am still fine tuning my model, the final result may be improved
### Training
`python train_frcnn.py -p [model path]`

### Note!
I meet a strange problem about my model. When using GUI to get the predicted image, the first time works well but turns bad in second time with the same image. Please restart the kernal to get the correct reulst. 
Professor has no idea about that, I will try to solve it.
